<H4>Week 12 Progress Report:</H4>
<p>We are now in week 12 with our project. This week we are implementing the LED to 
our raspberry pi. The LED will blink when the webcam successfully scanned a QR code. 
So far we are on track with our schedule, we are going to present on December 7, 2016 
so we have few weeks to finish everything for our presentation. I bought a LED this 
weekend for $1.99 and now I’m on the process on making it work with the webcam. So far 
I did not ran into a problem, but there’s one issue, we don’t really know how to code 
with python and we need to use python to make the LED to work but there’s should be 
alternative ways to make the LED to work. It’s trial and error.</p>

<H4>Week 11 Progress Report:</H4>
<p>Week 11 into our project now and we have done the basic scanning QR code and 
displaying the data into a screen. Last week was the open house and we demonstrated 
our project to the class. Now we are working on implementing a led to blink every 
time the webcam scan a QR code and actually get the data that has been scan to be 
saved in a folder or the data get send through a php script that saves it to a 
database. We're still figuring out what's the best way to save the data. We are 
targeting to finish the led to blink by next week and hopefully followed by the data 
being saved when the webcams scans a QR code. For our project budget, we had spend 
what's specified in our project budget plan. We haven't spend more or less.</p>

	<H4>Week 10 Progress Report:</H4>
	<p>We have enquired all the hardware parts we needed for week 10 demonstration. 
	We originally plan to use barcode but we switched to QR code because we were 
	having trouble scanning barcodes. We ended up making the QR code to work and 
	it’s scanning as it suppose to be. We can generate our own QR code to specify 
	which items are being scanned and who is the student requesting it.  As for 
	the budget we haven’t spend more or less money that we said we going to spend 
	in the budget report.</p>
