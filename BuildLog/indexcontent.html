		<p>This build instruction will show how to build the “Prototype Lab Flow” project which consists of a webcam, 
			raspberry pi and a PCB. This project was designed by myself, Mathues Rondinille and Sukhdeep Sehra. 
			The purposes of this project make the flow of the prototype lab more efficient to take out items from 
			the lab and store them in a database by using a QR code. I will show step by step how the project is made.</p>
