		<p>This build instruction will show how to build the “Prototype Lab Flow” project which consists of a webcam, 
			raspberry pi and a PCB. This project was designed by myself, Mathues Rondinille and Sukhdeep Sehra. 
			The purposes of this project make the flow of the prototype lab more efficient to take out items from 
			the lab and store them in a database by using a QR code. I will show step by step how the project is made.</p>

		<p>The materials I’ve used for this project are webcam, raspberry pi, QR codes and PCB. The PCB is not required to do 
			this project; I just used it for the LED for light indicator when the QR code has been scanned. The PCB was 
			provided by the school. The raspberry pi needs a mouse, keyboard and a monitor. My project is not expensive,
			here’s a table that shows how much I spent:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Item</th>
				<th>Quantity</th>
				<th>Total Price(With Tax)</th>

				<td>Raspberry Pi 3</td>
				<td>1</td>
				<td>$101.69</td>

				<td>Logitech - Webcam</td>				<td>1</td>
