Approved Proposal
-----------------

*Proposal for the Prototype Lab Flow Project*

Prepared by Kenneth Mendoza and Sukhdeep Sehra  
*Computer Engineering Technology Student*  
<https://mndk0076.github.io/>

Executive Summary
-----------------

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The Internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for LCD monitor and a scanner. The database will
store all of the items from the parts crib for availability of the parts, and
all of the users and admins info from the mobile app. The mobile device
functionality will include a mobile app for users to request items, a LCD
monitor that display the users requested items, a scanner to scan the user
mobile app when returning the items, a mobile app for the users to send request
items and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be
collaborating with Humber College Technology Department. In the winter semester
I plan to form a group with the following students; Sukhdeep Sehra and Mathues
Rondinelli, who are also building similar hardware this term and working on the
mobile application with me. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application will be completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent
term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

Background
----------

The problem solved by this project is to make the parts crib more organized and
operate smoother than ever before.  As of now we know the parts crib function;
student line up to write the items they may need and give their student ID with
the requested items then the worker from the crib get the requested items one by
one. This functionality takes up time, waste paper and pen. Students sometimes
wait for awhile in the line and find out there’s no more parts available. Our
project will enhance the parts crib functionality by making a mobile app that a
student can send request items from their phone while still in classroom or
before their lab starts and that request will be send to the parts crib LCD
monitor that the worker can see and start preparing the items for the student.
The worker will then send a notification to the student that his/her requested
parts are ready to be pick up. After the student used the parts he/she returns
the items in the crib, the worker will scan the student mobile app to see what
items the student borrow. This project will eliminate student lining up, giving
out their student ID, using paper and pen to request an item and student will
know if the parts are still available and when it’s ready to be pick up.
Overall, the parts crib will save time and money and it’s going to be more
convenient with everyone.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

The first article discusses how Gabor used QR decomposition for image encoding.
[\@250340]

The second article discusses how support system for QR codes based educational
processes. [\@7036011]

The third article discusses how VLSI implementation of hybrid QR code generation
system. [\@6892829]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Concluding Remarks
------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for *Future Humber
Quadcopter Swarm*. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills
developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating my ability to learn how to support projects such as the initiative
described by [3]. I request approval of this project.
