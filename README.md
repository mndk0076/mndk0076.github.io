Approved Proposal
-----------------

*Proposal for the Prototype Lab Flow Project*

Prepared by Kenneth Mendoza, Sukhdeep Sehra, Matthues Rondinelli and Gurpreet

Executive Summary
-----------------

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The Internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for LCD monitor and a scanner. The database will
store all of the items from the parts crib for availability of the parts, and
all of the users and admins info from the mobile app. The mobile device
functionality will include a mobile app for users to request items, a LCD
monitor that display the users requested items, a scanner to scan the user
mobile app when returning the items, a mobile app for the users to send request
items and will be further detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be
collaborating with Humber College Technology Department. In the winter semester
I plan to form a group with the following students; Sukhdeep Sehra and Mathues
Rondinelli, who are also building similar hardware this term and working on the
mobile application with me. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware
Production Techniques independently and the application will be completed in
CENG 319 Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent
term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

Background
----------

The problem solved by this project is to make the parts crib more organized and
operate smoother than ever before.  As of now we know the parts crib function;
student line up to write the items they may need and give their student ID with
the requested items then the worker from the crib get the requested items one by
one. This functionality takes up time, waste paper and pen. Students sometimes
wait for awhile in the line and find out there’s no more parts available. Our
project will enhance the parts crib functionality by making a mobile app that a
student can send request items from their phone while still in classroom or
before their lab starts and that request will be send to the parts crib LCD
monitor that the worker can see and start preparing the items for the student.
The worker will then send a notification to the student that his/her requested
parts are ready to be pick up. After the student used the parts he/she returns
the items in the crib, the worker will scan the student mobile app to see what
items the student borrow. This project will eliminate student lining up, giving
out their student ID, using paper and pen to request an item and student will
know if the parts are still available and when it’s ready to be pick up.
Overall, the parts crib will save time and money and it’s going to be more
convenient with everyone.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

The first article discusses how Gabor used QR decomposition for image encoding.
[\@250340]

The second article discusses how support system for QR codes based educational
processes. [\@7036011]

The third article discusses how VLSI implementation of hybrid QR code generation
system. [\@6892829]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

Methodology
-----------

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

Concluding Remarks
------------------

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for *Future Humber
Quadcopter Swarm*. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills
developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating my ability to learn how to support projects such as the initiative
described by [3]. I request approval of this project.

2. Software Requirements Specification
--------------------------------------

2.1 Product Introduction
------------------------

2.1.1 Purpose
-------------

2.1.2 Product Overview
----------------------

2.2 Overall Description
-----------------------

2.2.1 Database
--------------

Our main goal with the database is to make it store the user’s information,
mainly user’s student number so that it can be assigned to the corresponding
item or time. It will also have all items available in the prototype lab, such
as raspberry pi and ardoino so that students may be able to request them. The
main function of the database will be to store the time slots that users will be
able to reserve in order to use the prototype lab. Once the time is reserved by
a student, its student number will get assigned to that time slot and will not
be able to be requested by any other student. In order to cancel the time
reservation the student will have to do so 24 hours prior to the time reserved.
By accessing the student information stored in the database, we will also be
able to limit access to the prototype lab as requested by Kelly. The access
limit will be done as requested by the prototype lab, and will be done by group
such as computer engineering, electrical, design and we will be able to restrict
a day or a certain amount of time to that specific group. We will be using MySQL
to create the database and hostinger, which is a free hosting website. Kenneth
will be in charge of the database.

2.2.2 Web Interface
-------------------

Our web application is going to allow the student to register and/or log in to
his account. The application will allow students to book a time through the web
page and also check history of items or booked time slots in the past. The admin
will have access to the student’s information and to the info graphs just as in
the app. Development of the website will rely heavily on how well we are doing
with the application. The more progress we can achieve on it the more time we
will have to develop the website and add more functionalities to it. Sukhdeep
and Gurpreet will be in charge of the web page.

2.2.3 Hardware
--------------

2.2.4 Application
-----------------

Our application will allow the user to register and by doing so adding himself
to our database. Once registered, the student will be able to access the other
classes and request time slots and items from the prototype lab. He will also be
able to see all the time slots available and the ones already taken, he will
also be able to see if certain time period or day is reserved to certain group.
Once an item or time is requested by student, it will be displayed on his
account info. There will be two types of account in our application. The first
will be the student account and the second will be an admin account. The admin
will have access to all the classes in the app without any restriction and will
be able to see what students have requested, when and the student’s information.
One of the classes will be the statistics, where the admin will be able to see
graphs with all the relevant information such as what are the times that are
booked the most, by what group of students and the items that are requested the
most. The admin will also be able to cancel a time reservation or item request
from a student if necessary and update the student’s info page with the reasons
why time or item reservation had to be cancelled or denied. Most of the classes
will have access to the database, since it needs its information to display it
back to the user and it will support English and French. Matheus and Kenneth
will be in charge of the application.
